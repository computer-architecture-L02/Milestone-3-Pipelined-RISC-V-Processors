# Milestone-3-Pipelined-RISC-V-Processors
# Objective
* Review understanding of pipeline techniques  

* Design several models of pipelined processors for comparison  

* Explore the Branch Prediction technique  
# Overview
In this significant milestone, students are assigned the responsibility of designing multiple models of the RV32I processor employing pipelined techniques, as outlined in the lectures.  

The primary objective of this milestone is to compare at least two techniques to comprehend the functionality of pipelining a processor and address its limitations to attain enhanced performance. Given that the base processor has been successfully implemented in Milestone 2, students are permitted to reuse its components, thereby enabling a feasible timeframe of four weeks for implementing these strategies. However, it is noteworthy that individuals seeking to enhance the frequency and capacity of their processor must employ BRAMs. While not mandatory, their utilization is highly recommended and may result in additional credit.  

Furthermore, students who demonstrate a thorough understanding of the concept of branch prediction are eligible to incorporate branch predictors into their processors, which will be awarded bonus credits. It is important to note that all the prerequisites for communication between your custom processor (soft-core) and external peripherals remain unchanged.  

For undergraduate students, an additional penalty week is allocated to ensure the fulfillment of the milestone requirements.
